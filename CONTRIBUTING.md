# ü§ù Contributing to Polaris

Welcome to **Polaris** ‚Äî an open-source idea engine for impossible thoughts and structured breakthroughs. If you're here, it means you're one of the weird ones who believes in progress, imagination, and collaborative intelligence. You‚Äôre in the right place.

Polaris is still early, but the mission is clear: to create a platform where anyone, anywhere can share, evolve, and track ideas that just might change everything.

## ‚ú® How You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, scientists, visionaries, tinkerers, designers, writers, and weird thinkers. Here are some ways to get involved:

### 1. Submit a Sample Idea
- Create a `.md` file in the `/ideas` folder using the [Forge format](./ideas/example.md)
- Use clear structure and logic ‚Äî wild ideas are welcome, chaos is not
- Include tags/categories if applicable (e.g. `physics`, `bio`, `AI`, etc.)

### 2. Improve Documentation
- Help clarify and clean up the README, roadmap, or license language
- Add visual diagrams or simple explanations for newcomers
- Translate docs into other languages

### 3. Build Prototype Components
- Submit front-end mockups or MVP versions of the Forge submission process
- Help structure the database or schema for ideas
- Propose lightweight tools for the Crucible (simulation logic) or Observer (data crawler)

### 4. Spark Discussions
- Use GitHub Discussions (if enabled) to propose system improvements or ask questions
- Share ethical considerations, implementation thoughts, or research connections

## üö´ Don‚Äôt Be That Person

Polaris is about *respectful curiosity*, not gatekeeping or ego contests.

- No trolling or harassment
- No plagiarized content or fake credentials
- No monetization grabs or disguised pitches
- No trying to "own" public domain thought

Violators of this spirit will be gently but firmly launched into the void.
