## 💡 Summary

What if energy could be derived from the absence of heat?  
Not cold as in “frozen,” but stillness — a low-entropy sink from which usable energy could be drawn via reversal of thermoelectric or quantum processes. This idea explores converting the absence of motion (thermal, atomic, etc.) into a usable power source.

## 🔍 Problem It Solves

Current battery systems rely on stored chemical energy or mechanical processes. In environments where temperature gradients exist (e.g. space), it may be possible to use *cold* as an energy differential rather than a limitation.

## 🧪 Underlying Principles

- Negative entropy
- Thermoelectric inversion
- Quantum stillness
- Potential link to information-theory-based energy models

---

## 📈 Possible Mechanism

A system that leverages ultra-low temperatures to reverse conventional thermoelectric flow — or creates charge separation based on entropy gradients. Could involve metamaterials, phonon control, or quantum interference filters.
