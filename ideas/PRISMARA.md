## ✨ TITLE  
**Prismara – A Volumetric Display System Using LightDust Projection**

---

## 🧩 CORE IDEA  

**Prismara** is a volumetric light display system that projects 3D visuals into a mist-filled chamber using a controlled medium called **LightDust**. The Gen-1 system is enclosed — roughly the size of a desktop PC or mannequin case — allowing light to be precisely shaped within a stable, sealed environment.

Using laser vectoring, DLP projection, and acoustic mist sculpting, Prismara forms floating imagery inside the chamber. This first generation is designed to prove the concept and lay the foundation for future versions with greater scale, fidelity, and environmental freedom.

## ⚙️ CORE COMPONENTS & TECHNICAL FOUNDATION  

- **LightDust Medium**: Engineered nanoparticle suspension generated via 40kHz ultrasonic atomizers, producing uniform particle density for consistent light scattering  
- **Laser Vector Targeting**: RGB laser array with galvanometer mirrors for beam precision within the mist volume  
- **DLP Micromirror Projection**: Texas Instruments chipset enables 120Hz volumetric slice cycling (exploiting persistence of vision)  
- **Acoustic Shaping Array**: 20–40kHz ultrasonic transducers create standing wave patterns to hold the mist in shape  
- **AI Display Logic**: Real-time volumetric rendering engine manages layer composition, depth mapping, and mist optimization

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER  

Ultrasonic atomizers generate a fine, dense particle mist.  
Acoustic fields sculpt this mist into volumetric zones using wave interference.  
DLP projection slices light rapidly through the volume, frame by frame, while lasers add contrast, precision, and motion cues.  
The result is a **floating 3D light form**, anchored inside a sealed environment — stable, responsive, and tangible to the eye.

## 🔬 PRIOR ART & DIFFERENTIATION  

- **Voxon**: Swept-surface volumetric displays using mechanical motion  
- **Looking Glass**: Lenticular barrier-based light field displays  
- **Kino-mo / Hypervsn**: Rotational POV illusion displays  
- **Disney Research**: Acoustic levitation-based experiments  

**Prismara's Advantage**:  
- No moving parts  
- No glass or external surface  
- Hybrid laser + DLP rendering  
- True light volumes, held in air  
- Contained system for atmospheric control and safety

## 🛠️ PROTOTYPE PATHWAY  

- **Gen-0.5 – Proof of Concept**  
  Laser + ultrasonic humidifier in clear container. Goal: test basic scattering and mist behavior.

- **Gen-1.0 – Minimum Viable Display**  
  Desktop sealed unit with monochrome DLP, basic acoustic grid, and mist control. Proves 3D light shape in a stable box.

- **Gen-1.5 – Depth and Color**  
  Adds RGB laser control, volumetric rendering engine, refined mist shaping, and basic motion input.

## ⚠️ KNOWN CHALLENGES  

- Mist drift and dead zone prevention  
- Laser classification and safety protocols  
- Real-time volumetric rendering (target: 60 VPS)  
- Mist recycling / condensation management  
- Power consumption and miniaturization  
- Cost for broader accessibility  
- Regulatory approval for enclosed Class III laser systems

## 🔮 PHILOSOPHICAL CONTEXT  

> “It starts inside a box.  
> But what’s inside the box is light —  
> and one day, the box disappears.”

**Prismara** is not a product. It’s an invitation.  
To experience light in new dimensions.  
To collapse the boundary between imagination and visibility.  
To make the invisible, luminous — together.
