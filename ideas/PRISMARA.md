## 🔍 Core Idea  
**Prismara** is a volumetric light display system that projects 3D visuals into a mist-filled chamber using a controlled medium called **LightDust**. The Gen-1 system is enclosed — roughly the size of a desktop PC or mannequin case — allowing light to be precisely shaped within a stable, sealed environment.

Using laser vectoring, DLP projection, and acoustic mist sculpting, Prismara forms floating imagery inside the chamber. This first generation is designed to prove the concept and lay the foundation for future versions with greater scale, fidelity, and environmental freedom.

## 🧱 Core Components & Technical Foundation  

- **LightDust Medium**: Engineered nanoparticle suspension generated via 40kHz ultrasonic atomizers, producing uniform particle density for consistent light scattering  
- **Laser Vector Targeting**: RGB laser array with galvanometer mirrors for high-precision beam positioning within the mist volume  
- **DLP Micromirror Projection**: Texas Instruments DLP chipset enabling 120Hz volumetric slice cycling (persistence-of-vision continuity)  
- **Acoustic Shaping Array**: Ultrasonic transducers (20–40kHz) create standing wave patterns to stabilize the mist and prevent drift  
- **AI Display Logic**: Real-time volumetric rendering engine managing layer composition, mist density optimization, and depth mapping

### 🔄 How These Work Together  
Ultrasonic atomizers create a stable, fine-particle mist. Acoustic fields sculpt and anchor this mist into defined volumes. DLP projection cycles through rapidly shifting slices to simulate 3D forms, while laser beams enhance contrast, highlight depth cues, and inject spatial precision. Together, these components form a light structure suspended in air — contained for now, but one day, free-floating.

## 🔬 Prior Art & Differentiation

- **Voxon**: Swept-surface volumetric displays using mechanical motion  
- **Looking Glass**: Lenticular light field displays requiring glass barriers  
- **Kino-mo**: Persistence-of-vision fan-based visuals  
- **Disney Research**: Acoustic levitation experiments for free-floating particles  

**Prismara's unique approach**:  
Combines a static mist medium with hybrid projection (DLP + laser) for higher resolution than mechanical systems, true volumetric space interaction without barriers, and greater environmental stability through chamber containment.

## 🛠️ Prototype Pathway  

- **Gen-0.5 – Proof of Concept**  
  Basic laser projection into a mist from an ultrasonic humidifier inside a clear container. Goal: observe light scattering behavior and mist dynamics.  

- **Gen-1 – Minimum Viable Display**  
  Enclosed desktop unit with single-color projection, basic ultrasonic array, controlled mist injection. Prove volumetric rendering logic in stable 3D space.  

- **Gen-1.5 – Color & Depth Expansion**  
  Upgrade to RGB lasers, optimize mist uniformity, integrate full-stack volumetric rendering software.

## ⚠️ Known Challenges

- Mist uniformity and prevention of dead zones at larger scales  
- Laser safety classifications and eye protection protocols  
- Real-time volumetric processing (targeting 60+ VPS — volumes per second)  
- Condensation management and closed-loop mist recovery  
- Manufacturing complexity and consumer cost reduction  
- Regulatory approval for enclosed laser-based systems

## 💭 Philosophical Context

> “It starts inside a box.  
> But what’s inside the box is light —  
> and one day, the box disappears.”

**Prismara** isn’t just a gadget. It’s a window into what comes next.  
When screens are gone.  
When light has form.  
When imagination becomes visible.
